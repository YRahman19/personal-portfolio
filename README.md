# personal-portfolio

## Description

My assigment was to build a portfolio page, i was taught about flexbox, grids and media querys and needed to include what i learnt into my portfolio. While i had fun building my website it was very challenging for me, as i ran into many issues such as sizing of my images and just the overall strcuture of my website. I needed to create a grid to add to my portfolio, i was unable to get it right and think i managed to include it but not sure if it come out correct. I personally dont think i did it correctly and would most certainly need more practice in html and css. I was unable to create my website to the vison i had but it all comes down to lack of practice which i will need to certainly improve on. 

## Installation

I used vs code to build my sites and added images and favicon to my site.
